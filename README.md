## Andr√© Marqueda

üñêüèª - Hello and welcome to my repositories. I'm a computer engineer from M√©xico travelling through the lands of Cybersecurity. 

Right now I'm developing malware in several languages and using a wide variety of tools to create tutorials and further analyze my own PoC programs. 
As of November 2022, you will find a wide range of programs I did during my college years (some of them could be useful for academic purposes).
